# PA-PSD-B8_Queue System (QueueS)
This is a project for 'Praktikum Perancangan Sistem Digital'. The Queue System (QueueS) is a queue management system used to organize and manage queues at public service offices such as banks, tax offices, or public places. The queue system can help reduce congestion and confusion or errors when queuing, making the service process faster and more efficient. QueueS can be used to manage queues at the teller's desk (counter). Each customer who comes will automatically get a queue number so that customers do not have to wait in a long and disorganized queue. The queue system can also display the queue number being called on Seven Segment Display to make it easier for customers to know the queue number to be called next.

## How it works
- The customer takes a queue number at the beginning of the queue line.
- The queue number is displayed on Seven Segmnent Display, indicating which counter or table the customer should go to.
- The customer goes to the designated counter or table and waits for their turn.
- When it is the customer's turn, the system will display their queue number on the Seven Segment Display, indicating that they should go to the counter or table.
- The customer goes to the designated counter or table and receives their service.

## Features
- The system displays the queue number for each counter or table, so customers know where to go.
- The system automatically assigns queue numbers, so customers do not have to wait in a long and disorganized queue.
- The system displays the queue number being called on the screen, so customers know when it is their turn.
